FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BILLING POLICY
1. Identification and referrals: At each visit, you must bring identification ( e.g. current driver’s license or
government-issued ID) and a copy of your insurance card. If a referral is required by your insurance company, it is
the patient’s responsibility to obtain it from their primary care provider and bring it with you to your visit to avoid
having your appointment rescheduled.
2. Participating insurance plans: Please be advised we do not participate with all insurance plans at our facilities.
Please call your insurance to make sure your provider is participating at the location you are being seen.
3. Financial Responsibility:
a. Medicare: Patient is responsible for the annual deductible and/or 20% of the Medicare allowance for all
covered services.
b. In-Network Insurance: If HMGS participates with your insurance plan, the patient is responsible for paying
all copayments at the time of service. Annual deductibles and coinsurances will be billed to the patient in
accordance with the explanation of benefits (EOB) from your insurance. Patient will dispute claims not
processed or processed incorrectly according to their plan, directly with their insurance company.
c. Out-of-Network Insurance: If HMGS does not participate in your insurance plan, the following applies:
i. Patient will be responsible for contacting their insurance to ensure they have out-of-network benefits and to
understand what their out-of-network benefits cover and the out-of-pocket costs.
ii. Patients are financially responsible for all services more than the allowable amount of your insurance plan.
iii. As a courtesy we will submit a claim to your insurance plan. You will be responsible for the entire amount
due. iv. A deposit may be required to schedule appointments and/or treatments.
v.You may incur additional out-of-network charges for ancillary services (see ancillary services below)
d. Non-Covered Services and Self-pay: If our services are not covered by your insurance plan or if you have
insurance, you agree you will be financially responsible.
e. Ancillary Services: Certain laboratory, pathology, or radiology services may be required in connection with
our healthcare services or as coordinated or referred to by us. These ancillary services may be provided

We advise that patients contact each of these providers and your insurance plan prior to receiving any health services to determine if
these providers participate with your insurance plan for further consultation on cost.
The Patient is responsible for understanding their insurance benefit plan and what is covered, including copayments,
deductibles, coinsurance, non-covered services, out-of-network benefits, and financial responsibilities. Many patients
now have high deductible plans. Please contact your insurance prior to coming so you have a clear understanding of your
responsibilities.
Payment: Payment for all services not covered by insurance, copayments, and patient balances are expected the day the services are rendered.
Payment may be made in cash or check, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express.
Billing Practice: Once we have received payment from your insurance company and there are unpaid fees that are the patient’s responsibility,
you will begin to receive a monthly bill. Please contact our billing department if you will not be paying your balance in full. You will receive 3
statements before your account is referred to a collection agency. You agree to be responsible for all costs of collection, including court costs,
collection agency costs, and legal fees.
Cancellations/No-Show Policy: If it is necessary to cancel, we require that a 24-hour notice is given. You will be charged a $50 fee for the first
offense and a $75 fee for the second offense if you do not provide a 24-hour notice of cancellation or do not show up on the day of your
scheduled appointment. We reserve the right to ask for a non-refundable deposit for future appointments or discharge patients after multiple
offenses.

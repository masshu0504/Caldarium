# Caldarium Medical Document Parsing Framework
This repository provides a project framework for students to use to jump start their work.

## Recommended Usage of This Framework

We recommend that students clone this repository and use it as a starting point (inital commit) for their own github repository which will hold all of the project's data/files/scripts going forward (including: pdfs, python and shell scripts, PostGres dumps, json files, etc.).

## Docker Container Setup Instructions and How to Use boostrap and export_data scripts

### Prerequisites

You need to have both Docker and Git installed before-hand.

I recommend Docker Desktop as well. You can use it to easily see if the container/images are running. You can also easily use it to delete the container/images if you need a clean wipe.

You will also need Python installed for schema_validation.py

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to download the code onto your computer:

***git clone https://github.com/masshu0504/Caldarium***

***cd caldarium_med_parsing_start***


#### Explanation:

***git clone*** downloads the repository from GitHub.

***cd*** moves you into the project directory so you can run Docker and scripts from the correct location.

### 2. Build and Start the Docker Services

Next, start all required services (Label Studio, MinIO, PostGres, and any helper containers) using Docker Compose:

***docker compose up -d --build***

#### Explanation:

docker compose up starts all services defined in docker-compose.yml.

***-d*** runs the containers in the background (detached mode).

***--build*** ensures that Docker rebuilds images if there are any changes.

### 3. Enter the Helper Container

In order to execute the export_data.sh and bootstrap.sh scripts, you will need to enter the helper container within your command line.

***docker compose run --rm helper bash***

#### Explanation:

This opens an interactive bash session in the helper container.

***--rm*** ensures the container is removed automatically after you exit.


### 4. Export Data (After Making Changes)

After commiting changes to the PostGres DB or uploading pdfs to MinIO, you can export these changes by running the export_data.sh script.

All PostGres data will be dumped into a postgres_dumps folder as a file named med_parsing_dump.sql.

All files uploaded to MinIO will be saved into folders within the minio_buckets folder. For example, a pdf file named file.pdf stored in MinIO in a bucket named test will be saved into the following file path: minio_buckets/test/file.pdf.

On Windows:

***./export_data.sh***


On Mac/Linux:

***bash export_data.sh***

### 5. Restore Data (Bootstrap)

This script loads pdfs and PostGres data into the MinIO and PostGres servers.

MinIO: If you are pulling a version of the github repo that contains additional pdfs in the minio_bucket folder, those additional files will be loaded into the MinIO server when this script is run.

PostGres: If you are pulling a version  of the github repo that contains different PostGres data in the med_parsing_dump.sql file, that data will be committed to the PostGres server.

On Windows:

***./bootstrap.sh***


On Mac/Linux:

***bash bootstrap.sh***

### 6. Access Services

#### You Can Access the Following in Web Browser

Label Studio (Annotation Tool): http://localhost:8080

For Label Studio you'll have to create your own account.

MinIO (Object Storage): http://localhost:9000

MinIO Login -> username: [minio], password: [minio123]

#### Access Postgres with the Following Details

Host name/address: localhost
port: 5432
user: postgres
password: postgres
db: med_parsing

## Schema Validation

Once you are ready to validate your .json file (hopefully containing fields and values parsed from the pdfs) you will need to execute the schema_validation.py script.

## Licensing

This project is provided under the **Apache 2.0** license.  
See [NOTICE.txt](NOTICE.txt) for details.


The script takes the following arguments:

1. instance: [REQUIRED] the file path to the .json file you want to compare to the schema.
2. schema: [OPTIONAL, ENABLE WITH '--schema' FLAG] the file path to the .json schema that the instance will be compared against. Default file path is: schemas/invoice.json.
